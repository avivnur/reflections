The visualization shows the changes in the most common occupation in each state of the U.S. from 1978 to 2014, based on data from the Census Bureau. The visualization uses a map of the U.S. with different colors representing different occupations, and a slider to select the year. The visualization reveals several interesting trends and patterns, such as:
- The decline of manufacturing jobs and the rise of service sector jobs, especially in the Midwest and the South.
- The persistence of truck drivers as the most common occupation in many states, reflecting the importance of transportation and logistics in the U.S. economy.
- The regional specialization of some occupations, such as teachers in the Northeast, farmers in the Great Plains, and software developers in Utah.
- The impact of technological change and globalization on the labor market, such as the replacement of secretaries by personal computers and the outsourcing of some jobs to other countries.

Notes: The chart is visually appealing and easy to follow. It shows the changes in the job market over time and across regions. The chart is interactive and allows the user to hover over any state or job to see more details. This enhances the user experience and provides more information.
