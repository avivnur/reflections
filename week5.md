The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2023 is a visual representation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, showcasing interactive storytelling and data visualizations. 
Additionally, it presents trends for selected targets for each goal and provides insight into the measurement of certain SDGs. You can select one of SDGs you want to focus on, lets say SDGs 1: no Poverty
The goal of SDG 1 is to eradicate poverty by the year 2030. Prior to the pandemic, 659 million individuals were struggling to make ends meet on less than $2.15 per day. 
Unfortunately, the pandemic brought progress towards eradicating extreme poverty to a halt, resulting in an additional 70 million people living in extreme poverty. 
Despite this setback, it is possible for poor countries to achieve economic growth and eliminate extreme poverty without significantly contributing to global emissions. 
We can read full story about this goals more and we can sroll down there will be some interactive chart. For example:
